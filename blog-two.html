 <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>

 	<p>
 		<strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as JS, is a <em>programming language</em> and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
 	</p>

 	<p>
 		JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
 	</p>

 	<p>
 		The <strong>ECMAScript standard</strong> does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
 	</p>

	<p>
		JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
	</p>

	<p>
		Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design
	</p>

<h3>Website Client-side Usage</h3>

	<p>
		JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.
	</p>

	<p>
		All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.
	</p>

<p>
	Examples of Scripted Behavior:	
</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Playing browser games.
		</li>
		<li>
			Controlling the playback of streaming media.
		</li>
		<li>
			Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server
		</li>
		<li>
			Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.
		</li>
		<li>
			Redirecting a user to another page.
		</li>
		<li>
			 Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Web Libraries and Frameworks</h3>

	<h3>React</h3>
		<p>(also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>

	<p>
		<strong>React</strong> can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong>. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
	</p>

	<h3>Angular</h3>

		<p>
			<strong>Angular</strong> (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a <strong>TypeScript-based</strong>, free and open-source single-page web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
		</p>

	<h3>jQuery</h3>

		<p>
			In 2012, <strong>jQuery</strong> was by far the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of websites. While still in widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by
		</p>

	<h3>Vanilla JS</h3>

		<p>
			The framework-like moniker <strong>"Vanilla JS"</strong> is term that has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality
